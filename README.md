# sphinxcontrib-uwu
For sphinx projects that have a severe lack of uwu.

Why? Yes.  
<sup><sub>I wanted a pet project for playing around with sphinx extensions, this is essentially it.</sub></sup>


## Usage
Not sure if this'll ever see the light of day and be uploaded to pypi,
I hope no-one actually uses this (why would you?).

In any case, add `sphinxcontrib_uwu` to the `extensions` list in your `conf.py`, preferably to the end because of how things work, otherwise it's not unlikely that nothing will happen.


## Configuration
No.
